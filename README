Details about default variables:
-------------------------------

The default variables are organized in three main categories: general, site, and storm.

Let us start with general default variables.
--------------------------------------------

WN_LIST is equal to a complete file name that contains a list of the batch nodes 
hostnames and optionally the subcluster ID the WN belongs to. An example file 
is available in 
/etc/storm/siteinfo/wn-list.conf
Change the path according to your site settings. For more information please check
${INSTALL_ROOT}/glite/yaim/examples/wn-list.conf

USERS_CONF is equal to a complete file name that contains a list of unix users 
to be created in the service nodes. The format is as follows:
# UID:LOGIN:GID1,GID2,...:GROUP1,GROUP2,...:VO:FLAG:
An example file is available in 
/etc/storm/siteinfo/storm-users.conf
Change the path according to your site settings. For more information please check 
${INSTALL_ROOT}/glite/yaim/examples/users.conf.README

GROUPS_CONF is equal to a complete file name that contains a list of the local 
accounts which a user should be mapped to. The format is as follows:
# "VOMS_FQAN":GROUP:GID:FLAG:[VO]
An example file is available in 
/etc/storm/siteinfo/storm-groups.conf
Change the path according to your site settings. For more information please check 
${INSTALL_ROOT}/glite/yaim/examples/groups.conf.README

SPECIAL_POOL_ACCOUNTS is a flag. If not defined, YAIM will decide whether to use special 
pool accounts or not automatically. This variable MUST be uncommented if you want to 
explicitly use pool accounts for special users when generating the grid-mapfile. 

ENABLE_MPI is a flag.

Let us move to site default variables.
-------------------------------------

MY_DOMAIN is the host domain name. 

SITE_NAME is a human-readable name of your site. An example value is
SITE_NAME="INFN-CNAF"

SITE_LAT contains the position of your site north or south of the equator 
measured from -90. to 90. with positive values going north and 
negative values going south. An example value is 
SITE_LAT=0.0 

SITE_LONG contains the position of the site east or west of Greenwich, England 
measured from -180. to 180. with positive values going east and 
negative values going west. An example value is  
SITE_LONG=0.0

NTP_HOSTS_IP contains a space separed list of the IP addresses of the NTP servers
(preferably set a local ntp server and a public one, ex. pool.ntp.org). An example value
is
NTP_HOSTS_IP="131.154.1.103 193.206.144.10"

The following variables MUST be set mandatory in your storm.def file:

MY_DOMAIN="???"
SITE_NAME="???"
SITE_LAT=???
SITE_LONG=???
NTP_HOSTS_IP="???"

Let us move to storm default variables.

installing a mysql server.
